## Technical Background

After I graduate, I hope to become a full stack developer.

I have some experience in these technologies:
- Angular
- React
- Spring
- Firebase
- MongoDB
- MySQL

These are the top 3 languages I am most proficient in:
1. Python `print("Hello CSE 110!")`
2. TypeScript `console.log("Hello CSE 110!")`
3. Java `System.out.println("Hello CSE 110!")`

In addition to my dev experience, I have some experience in UI design where I've created mockups of some projects. I tend to make minimalistic designs, views that look simple and clean.

## Other

Things I hope to do this year:
- [ ] Graduate
- [ ] Deploy an Electron project
- [ ] Building something with the GitHub GraphQL API
- [ ] Land a fulltime job
